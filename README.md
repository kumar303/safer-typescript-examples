# Safer TypeScript With Generics And Linting

Here is the example code I used to write
[this article](http://farmdev.com/thoughts/115/safer-typescript-with-generics-and-linting/).

If you want to play around with it (if it still works!),
you'll need Node.JS 10 or greater.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Validation

To check that the examples are valid, run:

```
npm test
```
